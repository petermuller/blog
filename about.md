Hi I'm Peter, and I'm an RIT graduate with a BS and MS in computer engineering.
I like machine learning and computer vision applications and hope to make a career out of them after I gain some industry experience.
Most of my info is on the main site or on LinkedIn, so go there to learn more about me.
Otherwise, welcome to my blog, and I hope you find something here interesting.
